## SliMANO

SliMANO (Slice Management and Orchestration) framework is a plug-in based system that requests network resources and coordinates the interaction among network orchestration entities for its instantiation and chaining in order to perform an end-to-end slice. These entities could range but are not limited to management and orchestration (MANO), Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers and Radio Access Network (RAN) controllers.

SliMANO follows a microservices architecture and is divided in three main building blocks, namely the SliMANO Core, SliMANO Plug-in Framework and SliMANO Agents Framework.
